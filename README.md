# Migration Repo template
This repo is a template repository for the files needed for migrating Inventory data from a source system into FOLIO,

It contains example data and mapping files to help you kick-start a data migration into FOLIO

# Getting started/ Giving it a try
This is a quick guide on how to transform and load bib-level MARC records into a FOLIO tenant. 
## Prerequisites
* Make sure you have **Python 3.9** or higher installed. We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing various Python versions
* You need access to a FOLIO tenant, with the following properties:
   * The **OKAPI url** to the tenant
   * The **Tenant id** for the tenant
   * A **username** and **password** for a user with the right permission sets
* A file of MARC21 Bib records in .mrc (binary) format
## 1. Create a git repository for your settings and data
###  Create a repo or clone this one
Either use the GitHub button below to create your own repo based on this template

Or clone the repo by running 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FOLIO-FSE/migration_repo_template.git
```

### Step into the repo and create the example folder structure py running
```bash
cd migration_repo_template
python create_folder_structure.py
```
Also, you can use this script for creating folder structures for different iterations.

Your repository should look like this:

## 2. Add your data, and configure the settings
1. Locate the MARC file you want to use, and move it into the ```iterations/test_iteration/source_data/instances``` folder.
2. Open up the mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json file in a text editor and replace the outlined values in the picture below with your values:

3. Save the file   

## 3. Install the tools and make sure they can run
### Using poetry
1. Create virtual environment, install dependencies, and activate
```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```
2. Test the installation by showing the help pages
```bash
python -m folio_migration_tools -h
```
### Using venv
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
First, go to the root of the repository. Then run the following
```bash
python -m venv ./.venv     # Creates a virtual env in the current folder
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activates the venv
```
2. Install using pip:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Test the installation by showing the help pages
```bash
python -m folio_migration_tools -h
```
## Transform the bibs into FOLIO Instances and SRS records
The following command will invoke the first of the three tasks in the configuration task, the **transform_bibs** one. Have your password ready.
```bash
python -m folio_migration_tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ transform_bibs
```
Congratulations! You have now completed the first step. Take a lookaround in the results and reports folders in iterations/test_iteration to get an understanding for what has happened.
## Post the Instances into FOLIO Instances and SRS records
```bash
python -m folio_migration_tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ post_instances
```
## Post the SRS (MARC) Records into FOLIO
```bash
python -m folio_migration_tools mapping_files/exampleConfiguration.json --base_folder_path ./ post_srs_bibs
```
Now, you can go off and explore the records in the FOLIO tenant! Make sure to check all the reports and lists of failed records in the reports and results folders!
